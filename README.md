# Predicting missing values using machine learning and association rules
Project for Data Science course by Dr. Amit Somech.

## About the Project
This project aims to address the challenge of predicting missing values in large datasets by comparing the effectiveness of machine learning and association rule mining methods. The project evaluates the accuracy of these methods and provides insights into their strengths and limitations. The project emphasizes the importance of considering the data and the problem at hand when choosing a method. The ultimate goal of the project is to improve the data science pipeline by providing recommendations for practitioners and future research.
